654125128746463232|Wed Oct 14 02:42:38 +0000 2015|The #DemDebate turns to energy. Now isn't the time to give up on the American energy renaissance in favor of pipe dream policies.
654122421906239488|Wed Oct 14 02:31:53 +0000 2015|Obamacare hasn't come up much at #DemDebate. Small business owners I talked to today raised it often -- it's increasing costs, killing jobs.
654121750217793536|Wed Oct 14 02:29:12 +0000 2015|Glad #DemDebate candidates are having to answer how they'd be different from President Obama. Short answer: even more spending!

654117249977044994|Wed Oct 14 02:11:19 +0000 2015|Wow! Surprised it took candidates at #DemDebate so long to get to raising taxes. They all agree on that, at least.
654115518815838212|Wed Oct 14 02:04:27 +0000 2015|Waiting for the #DemDebate question that the candidates don't answer with "We need more and bigger government".

654109451797069824|Wed Oct 14 01:40:20 +0000 2015|Hillary asked about tragedy in Benghazi, says "I'll get to that." Better than her old position, "What difference does it make?" #DemDebate

654106287211454464|Wed Oct 14 01:27:46 +0000 2015|Hillary says the President valued her judgement as Secretary of State. Not sure that's really worked out for either of them. #DemDebate
654102400006029313|Wed Oct 14 01:12:19 +0000 2015|Be concerned whenever candidates start talking about which businesses deserve success. The government shouldn't make that choice. #DemDebate
654101044440485888|Wed Oct 14 01:06:56 +0000 2015|The fact that capitalism is up for debate tonight is sad. Nothing's done more to lift billions out of poverty &amp; into prosperity. #demdebate
