450674490679517184|Mon Mar 31 16:42:26 +0000 2014|With strong bipartisan support, The Smarter Sentencing Act is the next step in the effort to reform fed drug sentencing policies
450674415312056321|Mon Mar 31 16:42:08 +0000 2014|4/4 The Smarter Sentencing Act directs the US Atty Gen to invest savings from these changes in programs aimed to make communities safer
450674237381279744|Mon Mar 31 16:41:25 +0000 2014|3/4 Smarter Sentencing Act would allow certain inmates sentenced under old crack sentencing disparities to petition for sentence reductions
450674088634494976|Mon Mar 31 16:40:50 +0000 2014|2/4 The Smarter Sentencing Act would modestly expand ability of fed judges to waive certain mandatory minimum sentences when appropriate
450673970560638977|Mon Mar 31 16:40:22 +0000 2014|1/4 The Smarter Sentencing Act would reduce - but not eliminate - certain mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses only
450673860082688001|Mon Mar 31 16:39:56 +0000 2014|Here are the four things the Smarter Sentencing Act would do
450673755808104448|Mon Mar 31 16:39:31 +0000 2014|On avg it costs abt $30K/yr to incarcerate one fed inmate; that’s more than 3x the annual tuition at a public college or university
450673628477399040|Mon Mar 31 16:39:00 +0000 2014|Our drug policies have helped create unprecedented growth in US fed prison population – increasing 500% since 1980 @ChiTrust
450673521363279873|Mon Mar 31 16:38:35 +0000 2014|To build a new federal prison is approximately $350 million or more in construction costs @ChiTrust
450673403616563200|Mon Mar 31 16:38:07 +0000 2014|Think about this: It costs about $45M a year, on avg, to operate a federal prison.  There are already abt 120 federal prisons in US
450673161076768768|Mon Mar 31 16:37:09 +0000 2014|Our federal prison system today is dangerously overcrowded, operating at nearly 40% over capacity
