598579709388066816|Wed May 13 20:04:58 +0000 2015|And because we will, the 21st century will be another American Century
598579652790067200|Wed May 13 20:04:44 +0000 2015|And I believe America will continue to advance the cause of peace and freedom in our time.
598579604228444161|Wed May 13 20:04:33 +0000 2015|I believe mankind remains afflicted, and that its destiny remains in our hands.
598579557097086976|Wed May 13 20:04:22 +0000 2015|I believe America still has that genius.
598579418378833921|Wed May 13 20:03:49 +0000 2015|Only American leadership will bring safety and enduring peace.
598579298413379584|Wed May 13 20:03:20 +0000 2015|Protecting our people and their interests??, ?is the highest honor, the greatest burden, and the most profound privilege
598579022310690817|Wed May 13 20:02:14 +0000 2015|But increasingly in recent years, I’ve also met people frustrated by the direction of American leadership.
598578983832145920|Wed May 13 20:02:05 +0000 2015|I have seen American freedom and security play out in the lives of my parents, my children… and myself.
598578531103211522|Wed May 13 20:00:17 +0000 2015|It will reestablish a foreign policy based on strategy and principle rather than politics and polls.
598578498836385792|Wed May 13 20:00:09 +0000 2015|This approach will restore American leadership to a world badly in need of it.
598578473053990913|Wed May 13 20:00:03 +0000 2015|Those are the 3 pillars of my doctrine?-?American Strength, the protection of our global economy &amp; proud advocacy for America’s core values
598578171592638464|Wed May 13 19:58:51 +0000 2015|In this century, we must restore America’s willingness to think big?—?to state boldly what we stand for and why it is right.
598577980298829824|Wed May 13 19:58:06 +0000 2015|America is the first power in history motivated by a desire to expand freedom rather than its own territory.
598577908379033600|Wed May 13 19:57:49 +0000 2015|We must recognize that our nation is a global leader not just because it has superior arms, but because it has superior aims.
598577869342683136|Wed May 13 19:57:39 +0000 2015|The third pillar of my doctrine is moral clarity regarding America’s core values.
598577842343923713|Wed May 13 19:57:33 +0000 2015|In this century, businesses must have the freedom to operate around the world with confidence.
598577684046712832|Wed May 13 19:56:55 +0000 2015|I will use American power to oppose any violations of international waters, airspace, cyberspace, or outer space.
598577463216615424|Wed May 13 19:56:02 +0000 2015|Millions of the best jobs in this century will depend on international trade.
598577436436004865|Wed May 13 19:55:56 +0000 2015|Now, in the 21st century, you can access global markets in a single second, with a tap on your smartphone.
598577343901216769|Wed May 13 19:55:34 +0000 2015|The second pillar of my doctrine is the protection of the American economy in a globalized world.
598576839670386688|Wed May 13 19:53:34 +0000 2015|So to restore American Strength, my first priority will be to adequately fund our military.
598576739996962816|Wed May 13 19:53:10 +0000 2015|This is an idea that stems from a simple truth: the world is at its safest when America is at its strongest.
598576698322395136|Wed May 13 19:53:00 +0000 2015|The first is American Strength.
598576671734702080|Wed May 13 19:52:54 +0000 2015|My foreign policy doctrine consists of three pillars.
598576651794919424|Wed May 13 19:52:49 +0000 2015|Today, I intend to offer such a doctrine. And in the coming years, I intend to be such a president.
598576587617873920|Wed May 13 19:52:34 +0000 2015|One who will set forth a doctrine for the exercise of American influence in the world.
598576562468827136|Wed May 13 19:52:28 +0000 2015|The 21st century requires a president who will answer that question with clarity and consistency.
598576529359052801|Wed May 13 19:52:20 +0000 2015|What principles should govern the exercise of our power?
598576496156901376|Wed May 13 19:52:12 +0000 2015|The question before us is not “should we lead?” but rather “how should we lead?”
598576457997127680|Wed May 13 19:52:03 +0000 2015|We cannot bring about peace and stability on our own, but the world cannot do it without us.
598576347661750272|Wed May 13 19:51:36 +0000 2015|The stakes of tomorrow are too high to look to the failed leadership of yesterday.
598576298907160576|Wed May 13 19:51:25 +0000 2015|… a leader from yesterday whose tenure as Secretary of State was ineffective at best and dangerously negligent at worst.
598576260395044864|Wed May 13 19:51:16 +0000 2015|We simply cannot afford to elect as our next president one of the leading agents of this administration’s foreign policy…
598576192824823808|Wed May 13 19:51:00 +0000 2015|It is up to our next president to properly fund and modernize our military.
598576172780236800|Wed May 13 19:50:55 +0000 2015|It is up to our next president to right the wrongs done by our current one.
598576126605135872|Wed May 13 19:50:44 +0000 2015|I believe the onus of maintaining American Strength lies where the buck stops.
598576090303475713|Wed May 13 19:50:35 +0000 2015|When we fail to lead with strength and principle, no other country, friend or foe, is willing or able to take our place.
598575820785913856|Wed May 13 19:49:31 +0000 2015|We’ve seen peaceful protestors met with violence from their governments.
598575796098240512|Wed May 13 19:49:25 +0000 2015|We’ve seen cyber-attacks against our allies and our own people.
598575777517477889|Wed May 13 19:49:21 +0000 2015|We’ve seen North Korea expand its nuclear arsenal and continue its brutal human rights violations.
598575740561428480|Wed May 13 19:49:12 +0000 2015|We’ve seen China rapidly expand its military capabilities and take aggressive action in the South and East China Seas.
598575671800037376|Wed May 13 19:48:55 +0000 2015|We’ve seen hundreds of thousands of Syrians slaughtered at the whim of a tyrant.
598575613583052800|Wed May 13 19:48:41 +0000 2015|We’ve seen ISIL sweep across multiple states, commit brutal atrocities, and attempt to establish a caliphate.
598575546490982400|Wed May 13 19:48:25 +0000 2015|This deterioration of our physical and ideological strength has led to a world far more dangerous than when President Obama entered office.
598575507630751745|Wed May 13 19:48:16 +0000 2015|President Obama has embraced regimes that systematically oppose every principle our nation has long championed.
598575465628971010|Wed May 13 19:48:06 +0000 2015|He criticized America for having “arrogance” and the audacity to “dictate our terms” to other nations.
598575430321315840|Wed May 13 19:47:58 +0000 2015|President Obama demonstrated a disregard for our moral purpose that at times flirted with disdain.
598575359508893696|Wed May 13 19:47:41 +0000 2015|He enacted hundreds of billions in defense cuts that left our Army on track to be at pre-World War II levels…
598575259734802433|Wed May 13 19:47:17 +0000 2015|Today, as never before, foreign policy is domestic policy.
598575207763181569|Wed May 13 19:47:05 +0000 2015|Turmoil across the world can impact American families almost as much as turmoil across town.
598575169183973376|Wed May 13 19:46:55 +0000 2015|The prosperity of our people now depends on their ability to interact freely and safely in the international marketplace.
598575113571676160|Wed May 13 19:46:42 +0000 2015|In recent decades, technology has demolished barriers of travel and trade, transforming our national economy into a global one.
598575084207345664|Wed May 13 19:46:35 +0000 2015|Since the end of the Cold War, the threats facing America have changed, but the need for American Strength has not.
598575042453049344|Wed May 13 19:46:25 +0000 2015|And that weakness, on the other hand, is the friend of danger and the enemy of peace.
598575007950721024|Wed May 13 19:46:17 +0000 2015|American Strength is a means of preventing war, not promoting it.
598574942469238784|Wed May 13 19:46:01 +0000 2015|… eventually bringing about the conclusion of the Cold War and the emergence of America as the world’s only superpower.
598574906251419648|Wed May 13 19:45:53 +0000 2015|The commitment to American Strength JFK spoke of lived on long after him?—?across decades, across both parties…

587742489135583232|Mon Apr 13 22:21:43 +0000 2015|And because we did, our children and theirs lived in a new American Century.
587742393975185408|Mon Apr 13 22:21:21 +0000 2015|Because we did, the American miracle lived on.
587742305672568832|Mon Apr 13 22:21:00 +0000 2015|The final verdict on our generation will be written by Americans not yet born. Let us make sure they record that we made the right choice.
587742246436372480|Mon Apr 13 22:20:45 +0000 2015|But if we fail, they will be the first generation of Americans to inherit a country worse off than the one left for their parents.
587742191918825472|Mon Apr 13 22:20:32 +0000 2015|If we can capture the promise of this new century they will be the freest and most prosperous Americans ever.
587742130119901184|Mon Apr 13 22:20:18 +0000 2015|But I have chosen this course because this election is about them. Theirs is the most important generation in American history.

587741806541975552|Mon Apr 13 22:19:01 +0000 2015|...But if they succeed, the 21st Century will be another American Century.
587741746425020416|Mon Apr 13 22:18:46 +0000 2015|If their American Dreams become impossible, we will have become just another country.
587741647842062338|Mon Apr 13 22:18:23 +0000 2015|That journey, from behind that bar to behind this podium, is the essence of the American Dream.
587741600366759936|Mon Apr 13 22:18:11 +0000 2015|My father stood behind a small portable bar in the back of a room...so that tonight I could stand behind this podium in front of this room
587741442216296448|Mon Apr 13 22:17:34 +0000 2015|When I was younger, I didn't fully appreciate all he did for us, but now as my own children grow older, I fully understand.
587741357541691392|Mon Apr 13 22:17:14 +0000 2015|“In this country, you will achieve all the things we never could.”
587741305033195520|Mon Apr 13 22:17:01 +0000 2015|"En este pais, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos."
587741026913124352|Mon Apr 13 22:15:55 +0000 2015|Because I believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake, and I can make a difference as President.

587740224962240512|Mon Apr 13 22:12:43 +0000 2015|Just yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for President by promising to take us back to yesterday.

587739596059881472|Mon Apr 13 22:10:14 +0000 2015|If we remember that family – not government – is the most important institution in society...
587739493781803008|Mon Apr 13 22:09:49 +0000 2015|If we do these things, the American people will create millions of better-paying modern jobs.
587739294166462465|Mon Apr 13 22:09:02 +0000 2015|Now, the time has come for our generation to lead the way toward a new American Century.

587738752417542144|Mon Apr 13 22:06:52 +0000 2015|My parents achieved what came to be known as the American Dream.
587738676957843456|Mon Apr 13 22:06:34 +0000 2015|They never made it big. But they were successful.
587738586130227200|Mon Apr 13 22:06:13 +0000 2015|But because they were not born into wealth or power, their future was destined to be defined by their past.
587738520254418944|Mon Apr 13 22:05:57 +0000 2015|When they were young, my parents had big dreams for themselves.
587738433478459394|Mon Apr 13 22:05:36 +0000 2015|Here, we are the children and grandchildren of people who refused to accept this.
587738339186323458|Mon Apr 13 22:05:14 +0000 2015|Most people who have ever lived were trapped by circumstances of birth, destined to live the life their parents had. America is different.
587738080909467649|Mon Apr 13 22:04:12 +0000 2015|I am more confident than ever that despite our troubles, we have it within our power to make our time another American Century

430139913980641280|Mon Feb 03 00:45:21 +0000 2014|The Broncos struggles all a direct result of Namath jumping gun and tossing coin before Ref was ready.
430139352640143361|Mon Feb 03 00:43:07 +0000 2014|He was down
430139136545423360|Mon Feb 03 00:42:16 +0000 2014|Only way to slowdown that pass rush is a running game. Something Broncos can't do now down by 22. That pass rush created two interceptions
430138596671373312|Mon Feb 03 00:40:07 +0000 2014|This is turning into one of those 80s SuperBowls. All blowouts
430138303887998976|Mon Feb 03 00:38:57 +0000 2014|Disaster. That middle pressure on QB is always a killer
430137920193052672|Mon Feb 03 00:37:26 +0000 2014|I can't see the coverage from TV. But need to attack that seam in middle
430137458408587264|Mon Feb 03 00:35:36 +0000 2014|I think they can get 80 ball the way they are playing him
430137157949620224|Mon Feb 03 00:34:24 +0000 2014|Look for 80 now Peyton
430137009953599488|Mon Feb 03 00:33:49 +0000 2014|That was a great route by Welker. Using outside leverage awesome!
430136481953615872|Mon Feb 03 00:31:43 +0000 2014|He had the first and almost lost it
430134338706235392|Mon Feb 03 00:23:12 +0000 2014|That works too.
430134246762872832|Mon Feb 03 00:22:50 +0000 2014|It's there. They are coming hard at Lynch. Play action!!
430134082904018947|Mon Feb 03 00:22:11 +0000 2014|Play action now!!
430133987856904192|Mon Feb 03 00:21:48 +0000 2014|Rollout, good throw, PI in endzone. First and goal from 1.
430133843203731456|Mon Feb 03 00:21:14 +0000 2014|Play action or roll Russell out
430133641549991936|Mon Feb 03 00:20:26 +0000 2014|I think Seahawks can get play action TD here
430133472209174528|Mon Feb 03 00:19:45 +0000 2014|See. Came back with motion then inside give to Lynch. A little looser
430132828781961218|Mon Feb 03 00:17:12 +0000 2014|That edge run by Harvin now run twice trying to get Broncos to get OLB a little wider to open inside the tackles for Lynch.
430132361419034624|Mon Feb 03 00:15:21 +0000 2014|Chancellor is first quarter MVP so far.
430132198994620416|Mon Feb 03 00:14:42 +0000 2014|Good job #RadioShack on 80s commercial
430131920329252864|Mon Feb 03 00:13:35 +0000 2014|That was a pressure int. notice how forced manning to throw off back foot not set and ball sailed. Guy was open
430131238213799936|Mon Feb 03 00:10:53 +0000 2014|Broncos need to test this secondary downfield. Need to see how the refs are going to call the secondary play.
430130535063908352|Mon Feb 03 00:08:05 +0000 2014|Quick read middle to 15 on a LB. Right decision. Good play by D.
430129961597669377|Mon Feb 03 00:05:48 +0000 2014|Unless you get a quick read down middle go endzone corner for either a great catch or a PI. If not you take the 3 and are up 8-0.
430129384658567168|Mon Feb 03 00:03:31 +0000 2014|Go endzone with throw
430128824849039360|Mon Feb 03 00:01:17 +0000 2014|Yep. 89 bad matchup for Bailey. Out and up
430128627871916032|Mon Feb 03 00:00:30 +0000 2014|Seahawks need to keep attacking perimeter and crossing action from slot. Look for 15 again or 89
430127718215450625|Sun Feb 02 23:56:54 +0000 2014|See that? Throws really well when moving. Design that
430127538707648512|Sun Feb 02 23:56:11 +0000 2014|It's early but Wilson struggling with throws outside numbers. I think they need to roll him out a little. Does well on move.
430125468671811584|Sun Feb 02 23:47:57 +0000 2014|Right challenge by #Seahawks a first half time out not as valuable as second half timeout.
430125008464408576|Sun Feb 02 23:46:08 +0000 2014|Not sure how you call that short. Nose of ball hit the yard mark which was line to gain.
430124381306896385|Sun Feb 02 23:43:38 +0000 2014|That was a first down. Will probably have to measure from new spot but put it down on yard mark from back angle
430122541764845568|Sun Feb 02 23:36:19 +0000 2014|Didn't count on a safety. Revised pick: Denver 24-23.

4776011999|Sun Oct 11 03:09:57 +0000 2009|Tebow draw for a first! I think Urban is reading my tweets!
4775946572|Sun Oct 11 03:06:31 +0000 2009|A Tebow draw for a first right now would be a poetic way to close this thing!

4775684476|Sun Oct 11 02:53:25 +0000 2009|No turnover is good but one inside the 10 is like a real good punt. Again  If they don't give up quick score they win.

4775581530|Sun Oct 11 02:48:15 +0000 2009|If gators don't give up any quick scores they win.
4775546259|Sun Oct 11 02:46:32 +0000 2009|Ok we settled for next best thing a four minute drive that ended in 3
4775327502|Sun Oct 11 02:35:33 +0000 2009|What we need now is a five minute drive that ends with 6 on the board.
4774026564|Sun Oct 11 01:31:29 +0000 2009|Touchdown Tebow to Cooper. And we get ball to start the 3rd.
