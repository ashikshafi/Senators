# Senators' tweets on digital privacy 
This project was part of my doctoral dissertation. I looked at how the U.S. Senators talked about digital privacy on Twitter as opposed to in their real lives. I first downloaded all tweets sent by all senators from the 113rd Congress. Two Senators from 114th also have been included. Then, I processed the tweets with the help of R code above. The code discards the retweets, selects only the tweets contiaining words "NSA", "Privacy", and "Surveillance", and calcuates the total number of Tweets before and after the selection. In the end, it selects some 1200 tweets from a list of around 90,000 ones.
